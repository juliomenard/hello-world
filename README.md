Hi Future Programmer Julio,

As you read this, you may reflect on how much effort you had put in, in order to be accepted into Hack Reactor, and how much more afte your were not initially accepted. I can only promise that you will forget the additional work you needed to do and be happy that you were more prepared going into the program.

bye,

-Past non-programmer Julio
